# FancyFooter
I decided to develop a footer plugin for Piwigo, partly for fun and partly because a nice footer would greatly enhance a current work project.

The plugin currently supports the following:
A custom logo. FYI works best if its somewhat squarish.
Social media, including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Google + and YouTube.
Company info, including name, address, telephone, business hours, and a statement about the company.

In the future it would be nice to have some color changing ability in the plugin admin section. I also developed the plugin using the Boostrap Darkroom theme with the Readable Bootswatch options. Not sure how it will fair with other themes.
