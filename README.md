# FancyFooter
I am working on developing a footer plugin for Piwigo. This is partly as a fun way to learn more about Piwigo and partly as a necessity. The goal is to create a plugin that lets you place a logo, business address, social media contacts and maybe a few other things into a nice cusomizable box below the galleries.
